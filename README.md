# Superstore-Data-Analysis

Sales-Analysis
Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

I have answered these 5 questions through our data analysis mainly using pandas and matplotlib library.

Q1. What is the overall sales trend? 
Q2. Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
Q3. Which are the Most Selling Products?
Q4. Which is the most preferred Ship Mode?
Q5. Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-Category?

To answer these questions I have used many different pandas, matplotlib and seaborn library methods. They include:
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
